// Update v1.0.3 - Save my life
// Note: -
// + Adjustments to support latest changes of "Extra Slot Mighty" by iCloudius.
// + Added saving Score, Lifes and Continues.

// Release v1.0.2 - The Release 2
// Note: In this release we fix all possible bugs, add few new features, as well as widespread improvements for stability. Hope you enjoy it! -Fade
// + The script for loading and saving the act has been completely rewritten.
// + Now the second act will be saved only after the title card of the first act.
// + Now the boss battles in the second act on LRZ and DEZ will be saved separately, as a result of which, you will not have to cross the entire zone when losing on the boss.
// + Added selecting the zone act for completed saves (Press [X] to switch to the second act and back).
// + Now you can delete the second act for a specific slot. Simply press the [UP] key during the [YES/NO] Eggman sign. This will not affect the main slot saving, but only erases data about the second act.
// + Fixed saving/loading zones in the wrong order when using "Original zone order  mod, or in some other cases.
// + Fixed the strange behavior of the Slot machine bonus stage when loading the second act.
// + The green emerald will no longer be overlaping by the "Act X" label in Data Select.
// + Added compatibility with "Original zone order" by legobouwer9 (Install it below).
// + Added compatibility with "Mania Style Data Select" by Agnoristos (Install it below).
// + Added compatibility with "Sonic 3 Complete Sound Test" by mrgrassman14 (Can be installed in any order).
// + Fixed the disappear of main character art, if it was modified.
// + Improved functionality of the bug-correction script from previous versions. If it doesn't work and your save starts the wrong zone, then use the removal of the second act.

// Update v1.0.1 - The bug-fix
// Note: This small fix fixes the problem of saving bonus stages, and the inability to get out of them. If you encounter this, then just update the mod, and re-enter to your game slots to update data. -Fade
// + Fixed when the bonus stage was saved and you could not exit from it.
