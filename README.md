Q. According to what scenario is the zone act saved, and how to load it after exiting from game?  
A. The mod saves the current zone act after the zone card of the first act. After exiting the game, and when trying to enter one of the slots, the last save of the act of the slot zone will be loaded.

Q. My save was broken - it loading a wrong zone/act. What should I do?  
A. Make sure to update the mod to the latest version. Enter to the save slots, the bug-correctionscript will try to fix this. If you still encounter this, then delete the saved slot act. Simply press [UP] during [YES/NO] on the Eggman sign.

Q. I noticed a bug, where can I contact?  
A. Contact me in the comments of Gamebanana, GitHub issues, or via Discord on the Sonic 3 A.I.R modding server. Try to describe the problem in more detail.
